# Lessons from Private Equity

Working in PE has taught me to think critically about businesses, evaluate opportunities, and understand what truly drives value in the long term.

## What PE Really Teaches You

Most people think private equity is just about financial engineering. While leverage and deal structuring matter, the real skill is **understanding what makes a business valuable** — and what could make it more so.

At Star Course Holdings, I got a front-row seat to this process.

## Due Diligence Is Everything

The most important lesson I've learned is that **thorough analysis beats gut instinct**. Every deal starts with a hypothesis, but the best investors stress-test that hypothesis relentlessly:

- What are the key revenue drivers?
- How defensible is the competitive moat?
- What does the management team's track record look like?
- Where are the hidden risks in the financial statements?

## Value Creation Over Financial Engineering

The best PE firms don't just buy companies and load them with debt. They create genuine value through:

1. **Operational improvements** — streamlining processes, reducing waste, and improving margins
2. **Strategic repositioning** — entering new markets or pivoting product lines
3. **Talent upgrades** — bringing in experienced operators who've scaled similar businesses before

## Applying PE Thinking to Tech

What surprised me most was how applicable PE analytical frameworks are to technology:

- **Unit economics** in PE translate directly to SaaS metrics like CAC, LTV, and churn
- **Market sizing** uses the same TAM/SAM/SOM methodology
- **Competitive analysis** requires the same rigor whether you're evaluating a portfolio company or a tech startup

## The Takeaway

Private equity taught me to be **skeptical but optimistic** — to question assumptions rigorously while always looking for the opportunity hidden in the data. That mindset is just as valuable when building software as it is when evaluating deals.
