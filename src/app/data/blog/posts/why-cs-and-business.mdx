# Why I'm Studying Both CS and Business

In today's world, understanding both the technical and business sides of innovation is crucial. The best products are built by those who can bridge these two worlds.

## The Intersection

When I first arrived at UNC-Chapel Hill, I knew I wanted to study Computer Science. What I didn't expect was how quickly I'd realize that **technical skills alone aren't enough** to build something truly impactful.

The best engineers I've met don't just write code — they understand the *why* behind what they're building. They think about market dynamics, user behavior, and scalability not just in terms of servers, but in terms of business models.

## Why Kenan-Flagler

Kenan-Flagler's Business School gave me the framework to think about technology through a strategic lens:

- **Financial modeling** taught me how to evaluate whether a product is viable before writing a single line of code
- **Operations management** showed me how systems thinking applies to both supply chains and software architecture
- **Marketing analytics** helped me understand how data can drive user acquisition and retention

## Bringing It Together

The most exciting opportunities today sit at the intersection of technology and business. Whether it's fintech, healthtech, or AI-driven analytics, the people who can speak both languages — code and commerce — are the ones building the future.

This dual perspective is what drives my work: from building trading algorithms to analyzing PE deals, I'm always looking for ways to **leverage technical skills to solve business problems**.

And to invent it well, you need to understand both the technology and the market it serves.
