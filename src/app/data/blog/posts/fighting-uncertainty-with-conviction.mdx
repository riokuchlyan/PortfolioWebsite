# Fighting Uncertainty with Conviction

Coming into UNC as a freshman, I thought I wanted to do something with computers. Recently, however, I find myself more interested in deal advisory and consulting. Yet, there has always been a part of me that wanted to explore the world of startups. Dealing with this uncertainty not only causes stress but also leads to a focus on "quantity over quality." Consequently, I find myself working on many projects at once, but not being able to commit to any of them.

I've noticed this pattern in those around me as well, switching majors, schools, and career trajectories. I've since realized that facing uncertainty is very common, and I'd like to share my experience with it and how (I think) I've dealt with it.

## The Context

The primary reason for my multifaceted interests is definitely due to my surroundings. Coming into college, I was heavily influenced by my dad's tech background, wanting to do a CS major. However, stepping into college, especially a school focused on business, I found myself in conversations about investment banking, consulting, and similar industries. At first, I acknowledged such roles, but I never considered them. After all, I always considered myself a tech person. However, as I researched more about these industries, I became fascinated by how money moves around within our economy and started recruiting for them. My new career goal focused not only on the technical aspects of products, but also on how to scale and sell them. This naturally introduced me to the world of startups.

And this is where I stand today. Conflicted by my childhood dream of tinkering with computers, fascination with financial markets, and the limitless opportunities of startups. I wish I could go ahead and pursue all three, and while there may be some niche intersection I can pursue, I acknowledge that I will most likely have to focus mainly, if not fully, on one of these goals.

## Dealing with Uncertainty

### 1. Design for Failure

College is the time for experimentation. It is also the best time to fail. Although I mentioned that I will eventually have to choose one of my three goals, I am currently deciding not to. I'm aware that I am most likely spreading myself too thin; however, I want to see how far I can go with it and how far I can push myself. Either I will succeed, which is very unlikely but great, or this strategy will likely lead to failure. But this failure now will be my success later, as it will show me how far I can push myself and will force me to choose a path when I am on the brink of failure.

### 2. Plan to Adapt

I strongly believe being adaptable is the key to fighting uncertainty. I've realized that I am not fearful of just not knowing what to do, but also of the feeling of being helpless if I realize I did make a wrong choice. Being adaptable fixes this. Constantly learning new skills and knowing that switching interests and ventures, while difficult, is always possible helps defeat uncertainty. In terms of my education, pursuing a double major has helped me create interdisciplinary skills that make it slightly easier to adapt.

### 3. Just Choose

One value that I've centered my life around is to not be fickle-minded. I would rather commit to the wrong choice and commit myself to making it right than be uncertain about the right choice. This may seem to contradict my previous statement about always adapting, but adapting refers to changing one's strategy based on external and valid factors. Fickle-mindedness refers to changing one's decision due to internal factors such as fear. Consequently, I am not too worried about choosing the wrong career or venture when the time comes. Even if I choose wrong, I will somehow make it right.

### 4. Be a Problem-Solver

This ties together all three of my previous points. While there may be many skills that I can provide value to society with today, I am working towards an uncertain future. Like stocks, commodities, or any asset, what is valuable today might be worthless in the future, including the skills I have right now. Consequently, I consider my greatest asset to be my problem-solving abilities. I'm uncertain about what I will do in my future. But I know I will figure out a way to make it work.

I've found the best solution is not to fight my uncertainty, but acknowledge it. That way, I can plan my education to adapt to whatever venture I end up choosing in the future without worrying about making the wrong choice.
